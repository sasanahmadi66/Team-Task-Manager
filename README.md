# Team Task Manager

## Overview
The Team Task Manager is a web-based application that helps teams organize projects, assign tasks, track progress, and meet deadlines efficiently. It is designed to demonstrate the complete software engineering process, from requirements analysis and design to implementation and documentation.

## Features
- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure sign-up/login, role-based access (Admin, Manager, Member).
- **Project Management**: Create, edit, delete projects; assign members; track deadlines.
- **Task Management**: Create, edit, delete tasks; assign tasks to members; status tracking (To-Do, In Progress, Done); set priority levels.
- **Notifications**: Email or in-app alerts when tasks are assigned or updated.
- **Search & Filter**: Find tasks by project, assignee, deadline, or status.
- **REST API**: Endpoints for integration with mobile apps or external tools.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express or Django
- **Frontend**: React.js or Vue.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT or built-in auth system
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub
- **Documentation**: README, UML diagrams, API docs (Swagger/Postman)

## Software Engineering Process
1. **Requirements Analysis** – Define functional and non-functional requirements.
2. **System Design** – Create UML diagrams (Use Case, Class, Sequence).
3. **Implementation** – Modular, maintainable codebase.
4. **Testing** – Unit & integration testing (Jest, PyTest, etc.).
5. **Deployment** – Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku.
6. **Maintenance** – Manage enhancements with GitHub Issues.

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time team chat
- File attachments for tasks
- Time tracking
- Gantt chart / Kanban board visualization
- Integration with Slack or Microsoft Teams
